# Design — Bedrock IAM-role credential mode

Rationale and alternatives live in [ADR-0001](../../adr/0001-bedrock-iam-role-credential-mode.md). This document is the design portion of the implementable contract. Every `file:line` citation is valid at pure upstream `8e67ac5`.

## Governing principle

**Bedrock is an AWS service, so AWS Well-Architected and IAM best practice govern it: IAM roles and short-lived STS credentials only.** Non-AWS model providers (Kiro today, LiteLLM later) use their own conventional pattern — an API key, plus a base URL where applicable — and are out of scope for the short-lived-credential rule.

AWS's [IAM security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) states that for workloads on AWS compute, _"there is no need to distribute long lived credentials … to your workloads running on AWS"_, and enumerates the exceptions where long-term credentials remain acceptable: workloads that cannot use IAM roles, third-party clients or vendors not hosted on AWS, CodeCommit and Keyspaces. **None applies here** — AgentCore is AWS compute and all three Bedrock CLIs use AWS SDKs. The bearer token is therefore not a defensible primary path for this deployment.

Supporting: [SEC02-BP02 Use temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html); [AGENTSEC03-BP03 least privilege with dynamic boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/agentic-ai-lens/agentsec03-bp03.html) — _"Scoping privilege at each identity layer, backing it with temporary credentials, and layering contextual IAM conditions limits the scope of any single compromised or misprompted call"_; [GENSEC01-BP01 least privilege to foundation model endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/generative-ai-lens/gensec01-bp01.html).

## Document convention

At baseline `8e67ac5` the repository had no `specs/` directory and no documented spec process; this set establishes one. It therefore conforms to the platform's **own** machine-enforced artifact contract rather than an inherited convention:

| Convention                                           | Source                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| YAML frontmatter + markdown body                     | `lambda/shared/frontmatter.js` — `parseFrontmatter`                                                                      |
| At least two distinct `## ` H2 headings              | `lambda/shared/v2-sensor-contract.js:164` — `pass = h2Count >= 2`                                                        |
| Fenced YAML blocks with registry-defined field names | `lambda/shared/artifact-extractors.js` — `REGISTRY.requirements:92`, `REGISTRY.components:240`, `REGISTRY.decisions:279` |
| Rendered examples must parse back                    | `lambda/shared/test/artifact-structure-contract.test.js`                                                                 |

## Verified evidence

Established by execution or artifact inspection, not inference.

**Assumed, not verified.** That _billing_ aggregates by the chained session identity — AWS states the caller identity flows into Cost Explorer and CUR 2.0, but confirming it needs a CUR 2.0 caller-identity export and 24 hours, a customer-side action. That the CLIs accept env credentials **inside the AgentCore container** — verified at the CLI layer on darwin builds of the pinned versions; the container adds the MMDS chain, addressed by `req-execution-role-no-bedrock`. Streaming attribution — not directly testable here (CLI 2.36.36 lacks `invoke-model-with-response-stream`, boto3 absent); prior live evidence recorded 23 `InvokeModel`/`InvokeModelWithResponseStream` events all attributed to the AgentCore assumed-role session.

**Resolved, previously flagged unverified.** The [AIP page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.html) is normative — _"Application inference profiles aren't supported by the Responses and Chat Completions APIs, on either endpoint … rejected with a 400 error"_ — so the comparison table on the IAM-principal page listing Chat Completions as AIP-supported is in error. Streaming is named for neither mechanism, so the earlier framing that this favoured principal attribution was overstated; the real resolution is that principal attribution is _"based on who made the call, not on API parameters"_. The same page confirms _"System, geographic, and global inference profiles work normally with all of these APIs."_

## Contracts

### Binding value

Stored in the existing `bedrock` parameter for the scope (`lambda/shared/agent-credentials.js:22` — `PROVIDER_CONFIG`, module-private; its derived `setField` name is the public API surface):

```json
{ "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/aidlc-bedrock-inference", "externalId": "<opaque>" }
```

Discrimination rule: a trimmed value starting with `{` **must** parse as an object carrying a valid `roleArn`, else the write is rejected. Anything else non-empty is a bearer token and is never parsed. Field rules are in `req-single-parameter-encoding`.

### Broker result

An explicit `kind` discriminator is mandatory, because `con-missing-value-is-missing` shows the resolver treats a valueless entry as a missing provider:

```json
{ "binding": { "provider": "bedrock", "source": "space" }, "kind": "bearer", "value": "<secret>" }
{ "binding": { "provider": "bedrock", "source": "space" }, "kind": "role",
  "credentials": { "AccessKeyId": "ASIA…", "SecretAccessKey": "…", "SessionToken": "…",
                   "Expiration": "2026-09-06T09:53:40Z" } }
```

### Environment set on the CLI, role mode

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, plus the region each `envForAuth` block already sets (`lambda/agentcore/cli/drivers.js:69`, `:156`, `:227`). `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` is **not** set. Written only into the per-invocation environment clone.

### Grant statements on the Bedrock role

`<bedrock-account>` is the account that **owns the role**, which under a central-Bedrock-account topology is not the platform account. Patterns, never enumerations — `con-claude-model-fanout` makes enumeration unworkable and `con-gpt-global-cris-only` fixes which prefixes are valid:

```
bedrock:InvokeModel, bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream
  arn:aws:bedrock:*:<bedrock-account>:inference-profile/eu.anthropic.claude-*
  arn:aws:bedrock:*:<bedrock-account>:inference-profile/global.anthropic.claude-*
  arn:aws:bedrock:*:<bedrock-account>:inference-profile/global.openai.gpt-*   ← no eu.openai exists

bedrock:InvokeModel, bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream
  arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-*
  arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/openai.gpt-*
  Condition StringLike bedrock:InferenceProfileArn = arn:aws:bedrock:*:<bedrock-account>:inference-profile/*

bedrock-mantle:CreateInference
  arn:aws:bedrock-mantle:*:<bedrock-account>:project/*                        ← Codex only
```

The broker's own policy, in the **platform** account, carries `sts:AssumeRole` with the resource from `bedrock_assumable_role_arns`.

### Trust policies handed to customers

The **recommended** template names the broker as principal and constrains the session name, which is what makes the role space-aware (`con-session-name-condition`). Cross-account adds the mandatory external ID, per the [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and [confused deputy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) guidance:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<platform-account>:role/collaborative-ai-dlc-credential-broker-<env>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:RoleSessionName": "aidlc-<projectId>",
          "sts:ExternalId": "<platform-generated-value>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Same-account may omit `sts:ExternalId`. Omitting the session-name condition is permitted and sometimes necessary (a role shared by many spaces, where `StringLike` on an enumerated set is the better form), but it means **any space that knows the role ARN can use it** — the platform cannot enforce that constraint from its side, and the ARN is not treated as a secret. This is the reason `req-role-credential-mode` keeps role bindings out of user scope, where per `con-user-scope-self-service` any authenticated user could name an ARN.

## Security handling

- **Least privilege at each layer.** The execution role gains nothing (`req-execution-role-no-bedrock`); the only new IAM is one `sts:AssumeRole` statement on the already-narrow broker role, resource-narrowed by default (`req-least-privilege-assume`); the Bedrock role itself is invoke-only, geo-scoped and condition-fenced (`con-fm-fence-works`).
- **Short-lived only.** The invariants are enumerated in `req-credential-safety`, including that no role holds a credential-creation permission.
- **Honest blast radius.** `con-mmds-chain-live` means the container credential chain reaches the execution role and is _deliberately_ forwarded to the reserved MCP child. This design does not close that path; it changes what the path can reach, from a shared execution-role grant to a per-space, one-hour, invoke-only credential. The reduction is the security gain; containment of a compromised agent is not claimed.
- **Reserved MCP forwarding.** `lambda/agentcore/stage-materializer.js:466` forwards the three credential variables to the trusted `aidlc` bridge. Under role mode this carries live Bedrock credentials where the bearer never went. The custom-server exclusion (`con-custom-server-excluded`) is already intended in-tree and must be pinned by a test (`req-codex-scope`).
- **Confused deputy.** External ID mandatory cross-account, with the lifecycle in `req-external-id-lifecycle`.
- **Non-secret versus secret.** The role ARN is not a secret and should be shown; the external ID is. `RoleSessionName` is non-secret but tenant-identifying, and appears in CloudTrail and logs by design.

## Observability

`con-invocation-logging-off` has three consequences, plus one separate finding:

- **CloudTrail is the attribution evidence path**, not the invocation log. `userIdentity.arn` carries `aidlc-<projectId>` and appeared within 3 minutes in the probe.
- **Per-request metadata tagging is unavailable**, so AWS-side per-intent cost detail is impossible until an operator enables invocation logging. The in-app token × Price List figure remains the only per-intent number and must stay labelled an estimate.
- **Enabling invocation logging is an operator decision, not a platform default** — it is account-wide per region and captures every user's prompts and completions.

Separately: **Codex/mantle traffic may have no CloudTrail evidence.** No `CreateInference` events were observed within ~2 minutes of the probe. Cause unresolved — lag, a different event name, or not a management event.

## Open decisions

```yaml
decisions:
  - id: dec-v1-no-refresh
    title: v1 ships no credential refresh mechanism
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      Measured p50 5 min, p90 10 min, p99 20 min and maximum 34 min against a hard 3600s chaining
      cap, with an existing stage retry. Refresh was the largest part of the change surface and the
      whole source of a long-lived reusable authorization inside the container. The maximum is a
      single outlier in a 27-day sample.
    decision: Ship per-invocation credentials with expiry as a legible retry; add a tripwire and revisit on evidence.
    consequences: >-
      A stage exceeding roughly 55 minutes costs one full retry, losing the work already done. It
      also removes any need for a mode field on a grant binding, so the grant module is untouched.
  - id: dec-credential-delivery
    title: Environment variables, not a helper or a local endpoint
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      Verified sufficient for Claude Code 2.1.246 and OpenCode 1.17.20. A helper plus per-CLI config
      is exactly the wiring a future LiteLLM gateway would strand.
    decision: Set the three AWS variables per invocation and install nothing in the image.
    consequences: >-
      If refresh is ever needed, the loopback container-credentials endpoint is the preferred
      phase-4 mechanism because it is SDK-standard and keeps credentials out of the CLI environment.
  - id: dec-bearer-deprecated
    title: The bearer token is deprecated, not removed
    status: accepted
    context: AWS IAM best practice lists the exceptions permitting long-term credentials and none covers this workload.
    decision: Make role mode the recommended default and label the bearer path deprecated.
    consequences: Existing deployments keep working; the deprecation must be communicated in the UI and the runbook.
  - id: dec-explicit-discriminator
    title: The broker result carries an explicit kind field
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      auth-resolver treats an entry with no value as a missing provider, so shape-sniffing would
      silently drop every role result.
    decision: Add kind with value bearer or role and branch on it.
    consequences: A small contract addition, and the same lesson applied to the SSM value encoding.
  - id: dec-codex-scope
    title: Codex is out of the verified set for v1
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      Codex uses bedrock-mantle rather than bedrock-runtime, and mantle in this region serves none of
      the model ids tried. Its configured id is also a bare foundation-model id, which the grant
      fence deliberately denies.
    decision: Include the mantle grant statement, document Codex as unverified, and track both defects separately.
    consequences: Codex works the moment its defects are fixed, with no further IAM change.
  - id: dec-litellm-provider
    title: LiteLLM will be a new provider, not a third bedrock mode
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      LiteLLM is non-AWS, carries a non-secret base URL beside its secret, and has no IAM surface.
      Kiro is the in-tree precedent for a key-based provider.
    decision: Reserve a future litellm provider beside kiro and keep the CLI-to-provider map free of deeper Bedrock coupling.
    consequences: The static AGENT_CLI_PROVIDER map must eventually become binding-dependent; nothing in v1 makes that harder.
  - id: dec-value-encoding
    title: JSON in the existing SSM parameter
    status: accepted
    context: Alternatives were sniffing for an arn prefix, or adding a second parameter.
    decision: Store JSON in the existing parameter; a plain string remains a bearer token.
    consequences: >-
      No new path or IAM pattern and full backwards compatibility. A third credential mode is the
      trigger to replace shape-sniffing with an explicit discriminator field.
  - id: dec-external-id-scope
    title: External ID required cross-account, optional same-account
    status: accepted
    context: Confused deputy is a third-party problem, and a same-account trust policy already names only the broker role.
    decision: Require the external ID for cross-account bindings only.
    consequences: The simplest single-account deployment manages no additional secret.
  - id: dec-user-scope-role-deferred
    title: Role bindings are deferred at user scope; user scope stays bearer-only in v1
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      Per con-user-scope-self-service, PUT /users/me/agent-credentials is gated only on
      authentication, so any member could name a role ARN, and per con-session-name-condition a
      customer trust policy that omits the session-name condition lets any space holding the ARN use
      the role. A user-scope role also has no coherent attribution story - cost lands in the account
      owning the user's role while the session name reports the space.
    decision: Reject a role object at user scope in v1; leave the user-scope bearer path untouched.
    consequences: >-
      Chosen because it is the reversible direction - permitting a scope later is backwards
      compatible, forbidding one later is a breaking change. Costs one validation rule instead of a
      third scope's UI and documentation. Revisit if a per-user billing requirement appears, by which
      time a gateway with per-user virtual keys is the better mechanism anyway.
  - id: dec-session-name-contract
    title: The session-name format becomes a customer-facing authorization contract
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      sts:RoleSessionName is a documented trust-policy condition key, so the recommended template can
      make one Bedrock role space-aware with no platform code. That is the only control that scopes a
      shared role to a space, and it is strictly better than the alternatives considered.
    decision: Recommend the condition in the trust-policy template and treat aidlc-<projectId> as stable.
    consequences: >-
      The format can no longer be changed silently - customer trust policies will depend on it, so a
      change is a breaking migration. This also constrains the gateway future: collapsing to a single
      platform role would break every trust policy carrying the condition, which must be planned for
      rather than discovered.
  - id: dec-assumable-role-default
    title: Path-scoped default for bedrock_assumable_role_arns
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      A bare wildcard would leave the target trust policy as the only control. The trust policy is
      inherently authoritative for BYOR, so this is defence in depth against the broker being induced
      to assume an unintended role, not the primary control.
    decision: Default to ["arn:aws:iam::*:role/aidlc-bedrock-*"], with a bare wildcard as a documented opt-out.
    consequences: >-
      Imposes a role naming convention on the central Bedrock team. If they cannot rename, they set
      the wildcard explicitly, which makes the looser posture a deliberate choice. A mismatch is
      cheap to diagnose because req-binding-preflight reports it at save time. Narrowing the account
      field to real account ids is documented rather than expressed as a second variable.
  - id: dec-binding-preflight
    title: The bind-time preflight ships in v1
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      Without it, a wrong trust policy, a missing external ID, a session-name mismatch or a role
      outside the allowlist is discovered by a failing stage, which then retries, re-runs the whole
      attempt, fails again and reports a typed reason with no cause detail by design. Cross-account
      BYOR setup is exactly where operators err, and this is a sample evaluated in the operator's own
      account. Per con-broker-action-dispatch it reuses a seam the settings path already has.
    decision: Promote to must-have and implement as a control-plane-only broker action.
    consequences: >-
      Highest operator pain avoided per line of code in this change, and it is what makes both the
      naming convention of dec-assumable-role-default and the optional session-name condition cheap
      to get wrong. It is an input check, not a security control - a trust policy can change later.
  - id: dec-invocation-logging
    title: The platform does not enable model invocation logging
    status: accepted
    context: It is account-wide per region and captures every user's prompts and completions.
    decision: Document it as an optional operator step; rely on CloudTrail for attribution evidence.
    consequences: Per-request metadata tagging and AWS-side per-intent cost detail are unavailable until an operator enables it.
  - id: dec-spec-location
    title: Spec and ADR live outside the published docs site
    status: accepted
    context: >-
      zensical.toml declares an explicit nav, so a file under docs/ is either published or orphaned.
      A spec under .kiro/ is worse still, because .gitignore excludes that directory outright.
    decision: >-
      Keep the three-file spec set under specs/ and the rationale ADR under adr/, both outside docs/
      and both tracked, so the published site and its nav are untouched.
    consequences: >-
      The design is not published with the product documentation until someone decides it should be.
      Anything written under .kiro/ would be uncommittable and therefore invisible to a contribution.
```

Every decision is now accepted. The four previously-open items were resolved by verification rather than by preference: `dec-user-scope-role-deferred` and `dec-session-name-contract` follow from `con-user-scope-self-service` and `con-session-name-condition`; `dec-binding-preflight` from `con-broker-action-dispatch` making it cheap; `req-expiry-tripwire` from `con-stage-reason-structured` making it nearly free. The remaining judgement call is `dec-assumable-role-default`, which is a naming convention the central Bedrock team can override by setting the variable.

## Acceptance and verification

Per-requirement criteria are in the `requirements:` block of [requirements.md](requirements.md). These must be demonstrated end to end.

1. **In-container credential delivery** — Claude Code and OpenCode each complete a Bedrock call inside the AgentCore container using only the three environment variables.
2. **Fail-closed** — with resolution deliberately returning nothing, the stage fails, and neither the CLI nor the reserved MCP child invokes Bedrock under the execution-role identity.
3. **Attribution** — CloudTrail shows `aidlc-<projectId>` in `userIdentity.arn` for a stage's invocations.
4. **Negative controls, each failing closed** — a mismatched `projectId`; a malformed binding at write time; a role object written to a user-scope binding; a cross-account binding with no external ID; a role ARN outside `bedrock_assumable_role_arns`; a trust policy whose `sts:RoleSessionName` condition names a different space; an expired grant.
5. **Cross-tenant probe** — a container in space A cannot obtain space B's credentials even when naming B's identifiers.
6. **Redaction** — no session token or secret access key in any log group, and none under `/mnt/workspace`, after a full stage run.
7. **Capabilities** — all three Bedrock CLIs report `available: true` on the role path, with no `AssumeRole` in CloudTrail for the settings request.
8. **UI** — a role-only scope renders as configured in both cards, with the bearer field marked deprecated.
9. **Model fan-out** — a real Claude Code stage succeeds with the family-pattern grant, and CloudTrail confirms more than one model id.
10. **Bearer regression** — an existing bearer-configured space behaves exactly as before.
11. **Expiry** — a forced short credential produces `credential_expired`, one retry, and a tested terminal FAILED transition on exhaustion.
