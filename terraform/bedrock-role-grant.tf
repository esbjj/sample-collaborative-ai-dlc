# Bedrock IAM-role credential mode — the customer-side role grant
#
# specs/bedrock-iam-role-credential-mode: req-model-grant-families,
# req-least-privilege-assume, req-same-and-cross-account.
#
# The role that the credential broker assumes is NOT created here. It belongs to
# whoever owns the Bedrock account, which under a central-Bedrock-account topology
# is a different account from this deployment. Terraform cannot create a role in
# an account it does not manage, and it must not: the trust policy is the
# customer's authoritative control over who may assume it.
#
# What this file does is render, from one place, the exact two documents an
# operator has to paste into that account — the permission policy and the trust
# policy, both below. Rendering them from Terraform expressions rather than a
# copyable code block in prose means the account id, region wildcards, broker
# principal and condition keys are derived, not retyped. A retyped trust policy
# is how a dev deployment ended up with a single-space `sts:RoleSessionName`
# condition under a platform-scope binding: every space but one was denied, and
# the failure surfaced only on the first stage of a run.

  # ── One statement definition, rendered for two audiences ──
  #
  # `grant` is the customer-facing permission policy an operator attaches to the
  # Bedrock role. `ceiling` is the SESSION POLICY the broker attaches on every
  # AssumeRole (req-least-privilege-assume), which caps what a minted credential can
  # do regardless of what the assumed role's own policy happens to allow.
  #
  # Both come from this ONE definition on purpose. The grant is only ADVICE — the
  # role lives in an account this deployment does not manage, so nothing verifies the
  # operator attached it, or that they attached nothing wider. The ceiling is the
  # enforcement, and a ceiling that drifts from the grant is worse than none: it
  # would deny a call the documented grant permits. That is not hypothetical. When
  # Codex moved to the Bedrock Runtime provider the grant needed a fourth statement
  # (`project/default`); a hand-copied ceiling would have kept the three-statement
  # shape and 401'd every Codex call, naming a resource the operator had already
  # allowed.
  #
  # The renders differ in exactly one way: the ceiling wildcards the ACCOUNT. The
  # grant names the Bedrock account because a role's own policy should be scoped to
  # the models that account owns, but bedrock_assumable_role_arns may span accounts
  # while bedrock_role_account_id names only one, so an account-pinned ceiling would
  # deny a legitimately bound role in another account. Wildcarding costs nothing: a
  # session policy INTERSECTS with the role's policy, so the role's own — narrower —
  # resource scoping still decides. The ceiling constrains ACTIONS and keeps the
  # inference-profile fence; it is not a second place to express model scope.
