## Agent authentication

Agents authenticate using credentials configured through the platform UI: a Kiro API key for the
Kiro CLI, and for Bedrock either an IAM role or a Bedrock API key.

An agent CLI cannot reach its model until an effective credential is configured — the Bedrock AgentCore runtime's own execution role holds no Bedrock model-invocation permission, so there is no implicit fallback to the runtime's identity. A user can provide a personal credential in **Account Settings**, a space owner/admin can provide a shared credential in **Space Settings → Agent**, or a platform admin can provide a fallback in **Admin → Agents**. Resolution is independent per provider and follows `personal > space > platform`.

### Kiro CLI API key (required for the Kiro CLI driver)

Kiro API keys are turned **off by default**. A Kiro administrator must first enable them in the Kiro console (**Settings → Kiro settings → Enable users to generate API keys → On**). Users can then sign in to the Kiro portal and generate a key. See the [Kiro API keys documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/enterprise/governance/api-keys/) for details.

Save the key as the **Kiro API Key** at the intended personal, space, or platform scope. AgentCore resolves the selected opaque binding for each invocation and provides the value to Kiro as `KIRO_API_KEY`.

### Amazon Bedrock credentials (required for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex setups)

Bedrock access comes in one of two modes, configured per scope. **An IAM role is preferred**: the
platform stores only a role ARN, a credential broker assumes it per invocation, and the agent
receives credentials that expire within the hour. See
[Bedrock credential modes](bedrock-credentials.md) for the setup, including the trust policy you
need to write and the cross-account external-ID bootstrap.

The **Bedrock Bearer Token** is the older mode and is deprecated. Generate an Amazon Bedrock API key
in the AWS Console (**Amazon Bedrock → API keys → Generate long-term API key**, scoped to your
account and region) and save it at the intended personal, space, or platform scope. AgentCore
injects the selected value for that invocation as `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`. It remains the only
option at **personal** scope.

One of the two is required for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex: the Bedrock AgentCore runtime's
IAM role intentionally has no Amazon Bedrock model-invocation permissions, so an agent never
inherits Bedrock access from the runtime it executes in. That is why role mode uses a _separate_
broker role rather than the runtime's own identity.

For Codex, additionally enable access to the OpenAI models in the Bedrock console for your Region,
and configure a **cross-Region inference profile id** such as `global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol` — Codex
calls Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible Responses API, which refuses a bare foundation-model id. See
[Bedrock credential modes → Codex on Bedrock](bedrock-credentials.md#codex-on-bedrock) for the
version, provider and grant it needs. (GPT models are also available through Kiro, but Kiro
accesses them via its own API key — no Bedrock model access is involved there.)

### Where these values are stored

All credentials are stored in **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** as `SecureString` parameters:

- Platform: `/<project_name>/<environment>/<credential-name>`
- Space: `/<project_name>/<environment>/projects/<project-id>/agent-credentials/<credential-name>`
- Personal: `/<project_name>/<environment>/users/<user-id>/agent-credentials/<credential-name>`

The credential name is `bedrock-bearer-token` or `kiro-api-key`. An unset platform credential holds the literal value `placeholder`, which the platform treats as "not configured"; clearing a space or personal credential deletes that scoped parameter so resolution can fall through.

The `bedrock-bearer-token` name is historical: in role mode that same parameter holds a JSON object such as `{"roleArn":"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/aidlc-bedrock-inference"}` rather than a token. Role mode also uses one non-secret `String` parameter per scope for the external ID, deliberately **outside** `agent-credentials/`:

- Space: `/<project_name>/<environment>/projects/<project-id>/bedrock-external-id`
- Platform: `/<project_name>/<environment>/bedrock-external-id`

## AWS credentials for deployment

AIDLC Collaborative infrastructure still requires valid AWS credentials for deployment and AWS resource management. Agent CLI model calls never use the runtime's ambient AWS credentials: they use the effective Kiro key, Bedrock API key, or the short-lived credentials the broker mints from the bound IAM role.

Without an effective agent credential, users can still browse the application and edit draft intents, but credential-backed AI composition, Quorum assists, and intent start are unavailable.
